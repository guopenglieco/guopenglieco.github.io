Welcome to my homepage!

I am a third-year phd student in Huazhong University of Science and Technology.

My research interests include digital economics and network economics.

Especially, I want to use game theory to investigate how strategic substitutes between agents' actions shapes some interesting phenomenons. You can reach me at: guopengli@hust.edu.cn

        We study Bayesian persuasion with local strategic substitutes in networks. A designer commits to a public signal to maximize total activity. Equilibria are characterized by the network’s maximum k insulated sets for each realization. We solve the optimal information structure and characterize beneficial persuasion. While agents individually prefer higher states, the designer’s payoff is non-monotonic in the posterior mean due to substitution effects. This provides a rationale for downplaying mechanisms—revealing low states truthfully and mixing signals when high. Moreover, for tree, nested split, and core-periphery networks, the designer strictly benefits if the prior mean insulated set size is less than the highest state set size.

        We explore optimal monopoly pricing in the presence of local negative externalities among agents’ consumption. A monopolist first sets personalized prices, and consumers then simultaneously determine consumption levels. When network externalities are relatively small, the complement graph of the social network plays a key role in characterizing the equilibrium. Optimal prices are uniform when the production cost is linear and proportional to agents’ Katz-Bonacich centralities in the complement network when the production cost is convex. We further connect agents’ consumption with their degrees in several typical networks. The firm’s profit and total consumption decrease with network density, although the consumption of a specific agent may not decrease accordingly. Furthermore, in the context of directed networks, the monopolist charges higher prices to agents who generate substantial externalities for others without being reciprocally influenced. We also apply our model to the case involving large network externalities, where the monopolist exclusively sells products to consumers who constitute a maximum independent set.
